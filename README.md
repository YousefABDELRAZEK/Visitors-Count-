# Simple Visitor Counter

This is a basic web application that counts the number of unique visitors to a website based on their IP addresses. Each time a user with a new IP address visits the site, the counter increments, providing an accurate count of unique visitors.

## Features

- **Unique Visitor Tracking**: The application identifies each visitor by their IP address and counts them only once.
- **Real-time Counter**: The visitor count updates in real-time as new users access the site.
- **Simple and Lightweight**: Designed for easy integration into any website with minimal overhead.

## How It Works

1. **IP Address Detection**: When a user visits the site, their IP address is captured.
2. **Database Storage**: The IP address is stored in a database. If the IP address already exists, it is not counted again.
3. **Visitor Count**: The application queries the database to determine the number of unique IP addresses and displays the total as the visitor count.

## Usage

To integrate this visitor counter into your website:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YousefABDELRAZEK/Visitors-Count-.git
